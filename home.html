        <h3>How to: Find the best pieces</h3>
            <p>Budget confession: I used to have a bad Nordstrom habit. Needless to say, I had no interest in thrifting tips back in those days. Although I had a solid income in my 20’s, the money seemed to flow in one hand and out the other. Poof! I blamed my lack of funds on my “love for fashion.” Years into wondering where my money was going, it was time to confront a hard truth: My clothes spending was getting the best of me. Can you relate?</p>

        <h3>How to: Start thrifting</h3>
            <p>DFaness, another YNAB customer support representative, agrees on the importance of being fueled. When she goes shopping with her family, she says, “We can easily hop between several stores, and the hanger [hunger + anger] sets in if we don’t stop for a sandwich. It also gives you some time to recoup between stores. Thrifting is basically like hiking, but instead of mountain views you get discounts. Just like taking a trek, be sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring water.”</p>
