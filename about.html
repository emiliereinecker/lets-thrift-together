            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>When I moved to Sydney in 2018 with only two suitcases (one of which is full of Indonesian spices), I promised myself that I would only shop secondhand for my home and wardrobe. Globally, we throw out about 64% of items we bought, so surely there's something out there for me? But this turned out to be a much bigger task than I thought. It took me forever to browse through op shops. I tried online marketplaces but it was so unreliable. Don't ask me how many times I was ghosted by sellers. Once a guy verbally harrassed me because he couldn't find our meeting location (I'm sorry you can't read maps, my dude..) Long story short, I felt punished for wanting to reuse. So I set out to make secondhand shopping a much better experience for everyone with SwapUp.</p>
