                <h3>Tip 1: Set a budget</h3>
                    <p>This is especially applicable to curated vintage stores that tend to charge higher than charity shops, but it’s important to set a limit for yourself so you don’t get carried away. Just because the items are cheap, relatively speaking, doesn’t mean you can go overboard.</p>

                <h3>Tip 2: Do not rush through it</h3>
                    <p>aking it easy will help you enjoy the experience and up your chances of finding something, so block enough time for your planned route and remember it’s a marathon not a sprint.</p>

                <h3>Tip 3: Get a clear idea of what you are looking for</h3>
                    <p>Thrift shopping without a clear goal is like grocery shopping on an empty stomach. It’s doable but not ideal. Make a mental list of what you’re looking for based on what you already own. This will help keep you focused and on budget. In addition, save pictures of coveted gems and fashion inspiration on your phone for quick reference. This will make it easier for store clerks to help you locate specific garments or let you know if they have something similar on the racks.</p>

                <h3>Tip 4: Dress appropriately</h3>
                    <p>Many thrift stores don’t have fitting rooms, so you might need to wear something you can easily slip secondhand clothing over to try on. Secondhand stores usually don’t offer refunds, so you want to make sure your clothing fits before you buy it.</p>

                <h3>Tip 5: Check clothes carefully</h3>
                    <p>Check clothes for stains, loose threading, missing buttons and other potential problems. Be sure to turn items inside out, too, for a full assessment. If you’re considering an electronic purchase, plug it in to be sure it works. Even books should be scanned for missing or damaged pages. Any and all damage should be noted before making a purchase. Can you fix it?  Will it be worth the cost?</p>
